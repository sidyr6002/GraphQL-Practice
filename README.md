# GraphQL-Practice

This project is designed to help you learn the basics of GraphQL and how it works in sending data from the front-end to the back-end. It utilizes data from two endpoints: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos and https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

## Overview 

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to traditional RESTful APIs. This project demonstrates a simple implementation of GraphQL with a focus on fetching and processing data from external APIs.
